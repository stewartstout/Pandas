## the SQL code below creates an AVERAGEIFS function from Excel in SQL in ColZ
## TableA is the table you want to modify; TableB is the source data
## In psuedocode, you are executing the following: 
## - return the average of ColA in TableB 
## - for rows in which the values of Columns B, C, and D in TableB are the same as those in TableA
## - and for rows in which the values of Column E in TableB is 'XYZ'

UPDATE TableA
SET ColZ = alias.avg_ColA
FROM  

(

		SELECT ColB, ColC, ColD,
			avg(ColA) as avg_ColA
		FROM TableB
		WHERE ColE = 'XYZ'
		GROUP BY ColB, ColC, ColD

)

as alias

WHERE
	TableA.ColB = alias.ColB AND
	TableA.ColC = alias.ColC AND
	TableA.ColD = alias.ColD;
